This is an XR editor. The page has two buttons, one to view your creations and one to open
the editor. Any scenes you create will be yours to keep.  The actual editor is hosted
on vr.josh.earth but all your documents are kept here on this glitch.

On the back-end,

- add frameworks and packages in `package.json`
- safely store app secrets in `.env` (nobody can see this but you and people you invite)
