# scripting cheat sheet

* the behavior script itself has a bunch of special properties which gives you access to lots of things. 
* the event passed to your event handler has a target property which is the object the event happened on. In most cases this will be the object the behavior is added to

#### event

Each event handler receives a single parameter, `event`, which contains the following properties.

* `event.type`: the type of the event. `tick`, `exit`, etc.
* `event.target`:  the ThreeJS object this behavior is attached to
* `event.graphTarget`: the graph document object this behavior is attached to
* `event.time`: the time of the most recent tick event
* `event.deltaTime`: (only in `tick`) the elapsed time since last tick
* `event.name`: (only in `message`) the name of the message
* `event.data`: arbitrary data in `message`, and optional event specific data in other events
	
#### behavior event handlers:

* `start()`: called on system start, even if you arenâ€™t in the current scene
* `enter()`: called when entering a scene
* `exit()`: called when exiting a scene
* `tick()`: called each time the graphics will be rendered, 30 or more times per second
* `stop()` called when the system stops
* `click()` called when a user taps (touch device) or clicks (mouse) on an object
* `message()`: called when a message is received

Note: `message` events are directed at one object by a script, and only go to that object. `start`and `stop` events go to all behaviors in the project when the system starts are stops. `enter` and `exit` go to all behaviors in a scene when the scene is entered or exited. `tick` events go to all behaviors in a scene each frame.  `click` events go to the object clicked on, and then bubble up their ancestors in sequence until a script captures the event with `this.captureEvent`, of the root of the scene is reached.  `message` events only go to the object they were directed at.

#### properties available to behavior event handlers

* `this.behavior` get the behavior object for this instance of the behavior
* `this.logger`: the logger for logging messages remotely. ex:  `this.logger.log("i'm doing cool stuff here")`
* `this.camera`: a reference to the current ThreeJS camera. ex: `console.log(this.camera.position)`
* `this.tween`: a reference to the tween manager. ex: `this.tween.prop({from:0, to:1.5})`
* `this.properties`: the property settings for this behavior. ex: if a behavior has a speed property you can access it with `this.properties.speed`.  Note that accessing `this.properties` may be expensive in some instances, so calling it once at the beginning of an event handler and using the saved values later is suggested (e.g., `let props = this.properties`) 
* `this.globalState`: a place to set values that every behavior can access
* `this.globals` get a reference to useful global variables

### methods available to behavior event handlers

* `this.getCurrentScene()`: a reference to the current scene
* `this.getThreeObjectByTitle(title)`: find the ThreeJS object by its title
* `this.getThreeObjectById(id)`: find the ThreeJS object by its title
* `this.getObjectByTitle(title)`: find an object by its title
* `this.getObjectById(id)`: find the document object by its id
* `this.getAssetByTitle(title)`: find an asset by its title. Assets have `play()` and `stop()` methods on them
* `this.navigateScene(id)`: navigate to a new scene, by id
* `this.playSound(id)`: (deprecated) play a sound by id
* `this.playMedia(id)` : play a sound or video by id
* `this.stopMedia(id)` : stop a sound or video by id
* `this.fireEvent(type, data, (optional) target)`: send an event to a target object (default is object behavior is attached to). `data` will be in the event `data` property.  Note that any event sent with `this.fireEvent` bubbles up the graph, so sending an event to an object will cause all of the ancestors of the object to see it as well, unless it is `captured` by a handler.
* `this.captureEvent()` : capture a received event so it does not bubble up to the ancestors above this event 
* `this.sendMessage(name, data, (optional) target)`: send a `message` event to a target object (default is object behavior is attached to). `data` and `name` will be in the event `data` and `name` properties.  `message` events sent this way do not bubble up to the ancestors of the target object.

#### logger

Instead of using `console.log()` you can use `this.logger.log()`. This will print
output to the console prepended with `LOGGER` and also send it over the network to any other instance
of the editor that is editing the same document. This means you can use the desktop editor to view the output
of a document running on your iPhone.  You can also use `this.logger.error()` which does the same thing
but prepends the output text with `LOGGER ERROR`.

#### globals

You can call `this.globals` to get an object full of globals.  Currently the following globals are defined
* THREE: the ThreeJS top level object
* GLTFLoader: 
* GPUParticles:
* WebLayer3D:

Ex: to create a new Mesh at runtime with ThreeJS do:

```javascript

({
  start:function(evt) {
      const THREE = this.globals.THREE
      const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(
          new THREE.SphereGeometry(1),
          new THREE.MeshLambertMaterial({color:'red'})
      )
      mesh.position.set(3,0,-5)
      const sc = this.getCurrentScene()
      console.log("the scene is",sc)
      const scene = this.getThreeObjectByTitle(sc.title)
      scene.add(mesh)
  }
})

```

#### Asset object
	
* Asset object, returned by getAsset(name)
	* play()
	* stop()

Properties for behaviors are specified as a map of key names to prop definitions. The definitions look like this:
```javascript
properties: {
	//a number property
	distance: { 
		type:'number',  //the type
		value:2  //initial value
	},

  //a string
	enterMessage: {
		type:'string',
		title:'enter message',
		value:'entered'
	},

  //a multiline string
	enterMessage: {
		type:'string',
		title:'enter message',
    value:'entered',
    hints: {
        multiline:true,
    }    
	},

  // a reference to another node
	exitMessage: {
		type:'enum',
		value:null,
		hints: {
			type:'node',
			nodeType:'scene'
		}
	},

	//a reference to a video asset
	video: {
		type:'enum',
		value:null,
		hints: {
			type:'video'
		}
	},

},
```

## Examples
```javascript
//move object two meters to the right when it is clicked
click(evt) {
   evt.target.position.x += 2
}

//spin target object using configurable speed
tick(evt) {
    let degrees = 2 * Math.PI * (evt.deltaTime/1000) * this.properties.speed 
    evt.target.rotation.y += degrees
}

//listen for message event with name "proximity-enter" and start particles
message(evt) {
	if(evt.name === 'proximity-enter') {
		this.getObjectByTitle('fountain').start()
  }
}

//when scene enters, rotate target 4 times then play a sound
enter(evt) {
	this.tween.prop({
		target: e.target.rotation
		property: 'y',
		duration: 2.0,
		from: 0,
		to: toRadians(360)
		loop: 4,
  }).action(()=>{
		this.getAssetByTitle('chime').play()
  }).start()
}
```

The Tween API lets you create animations that are chained together in parallel or sequence.

### rotate the target object once
``` javascript
({
  // defines a target property. must be a scene
    enter: function(e) {
        this.tween.prop({
            duration:1.0,
            target:e.target.rotation,
            property:'y',
            from:0,
            to:3.14*2,
            loop:1,
        }).start()
    },
})
```

### rotate the target object around y and also move x from -1 to 1, in sequence
``` javascript
({
  // defines a target property. must be a scene
    enter: function(e) {
        this.tween.sequence()
            .then(this.tween.prop({
                duration:1.0,
                target:e.target.rotation,
                property:'y',
                from:0,
                to:3.14*2,
                loop:1,
            }))
            .then(this.tween.prop({
                duration:1.0,
                target:e.target.position,
                property:'x',
                from:-1,
                to:1,
            }))
            .start()
    },
})
```

### rotate the target object around y and also move x from -1 to 1, in parallel
``` javascript
({
  // defines a target property. must be a scene
    enter: function(e) {
        this.tween.parallel()
            .and(this.tween.prop({
                duration:1.0,
                target:e.target.rotation,
                property:'y',
                from:0,
                to:3.14*2,
                loop:1,
            }))
            .and(this.tween.prop({
                duration:1.0,
                target:e.target.position,
                property:'x',
                from:-1,
                to:1,
            }))
            .start()
    },
})
```

### move the x from -1 to 1, then back, then print a message
``` javascript
({
  // defines a target property. must be a scene
    enter: function(e) {
        this.tween.sequence()
            .then(this.tween.prop({
                duration:1.0,
                target:e.target.position,
                property:'x',
                from:-1,
                to:1,
                autoReverse:true,
            }))
            .then(()=> {
                this.logger.log("done here")
            })
            .start()
    },
})
```
